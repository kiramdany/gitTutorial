### Why is Git called Git?

-   Linus Torvalds who created Linux needed a version control system
-   Couldn't find one good enough so he decided to build one
-   He would always, in a self confessed egotistical manner, name projects after himself
-   Such as Linux = 'Linus' + 'Unix' ( literally named it after himself )
-   And inline with his self deprecating humour he decided to name this version control system 'Git'

### Git(?!Hub)

-   Don't confuse Git and GitHub ( When I first started I didn't really know the difference )
-   They are not the same thing
-   We will be using GitHub to facilitate this tutorial, however we could have just as easily similar tools such as bitbucket
-   In this the focus is Git
