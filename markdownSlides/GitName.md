### Why is Git called Git?

-   Linus Torvalds who created Linux also created Git
-   Linux = 'Linus' + 'Unix' ( literally named it after himself )
-   In his self deprecating humour would call himself a git
-   And so Git is also named after him

### Git(?!Hub)

-   Don't confuse Git and GitHub ( When I first started I didn't really know the difference)
-   They are not the same thing
-   Don't worry about GitHub for now, I may explain it later
-   But in this we are focussing on Git
